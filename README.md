## Abstract
In the first part of the analysis where we used two different methods to analyze the correlation between cryptos and Bitcoin, we have convincing results showing a clear correlation using low frequency data. We have also seen that some external factors such as a worldwide lockdown period must have had an impact on the cryptos market because they were found to be more correlated than usual. Then we analyzed a period when cryptos were decorrelated with Bitcoin. Using Hayashi Yoshida's method, which allowed us to analyze the correlation at the highest possible frequency - tick-by-tick data - by getting rid of the problem of asynchronous trading, we were able to highlight anomalies in the returns that caused this decorrelation. Unfortunately, we cannot overcome the Epps Effect in this high-frequency analysis. 

In the second part of the analysis, we quantified cryptocurrencies' trades influence over their own price and others' using response functions. The results weren't as concluding as we would have thought, but still, judging from our analysis and observations, we can affirm that cryptocurrencies do influence each other's price by trading. In particular, BTC's trades do have an influence over most of the studied cryptocurrencies, even in the long run. Finally, we have seen that extreme conditions such as flash crashes in the world of cryptocurrencies is reflected by extreme behaviour of these functions.

In the future, we could run the same analysis with data that is less aggregated, which could lead to results that are more granular and potentially a better reflection of the reality. Moreover, regarding the work done in Section 3, we could introduce the number of trades into the response functions in order to analyze response functions not only as functions of the cryptocurrency's price but also as functions of the cryptocurrency's activity. This may lead to new results, and meaningful insights.
