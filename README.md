# Bitcoin impact on several major cryptocurrencies

## Abstract

Classical currencies are generally fairly correlated with the price of some commodities. For example, the Australian dollar is known to be a currency sensitive to basic products such as iron ore, or the Russian ruble is related to oil. In addition to being correlated to these commodities, currencies are sensitive to the US dollar rate. It's a little bit the same system we find with cryptomoney. Each cryptomoney has its own utility and specificities. For example, Ethereum was one of the first cryptomoney systems to offer smart contracts, a way of programming the blockchain to be used in new contexts (securing a transparent agreement between two parties, automating payment and eliminating the risk of non-payment, reducing intermediate costs in the development, monitoring and conclusion of a contract...). Another example is Ripple, which aims to enable secure, instantaneous and almost free global financial transactions of any size without chargebacks. The value of these cryptomonnages varies according to the utility they have at a given moment but also varies according to the price of Bitcoin, which is more speculative. 
    
The current health crisis due to the Covid-19 epidemic raises doubts about a financial crisis in the coming months. This downturn could potentially be beneficial to cryptomarkets. In this context, our goal is to analyze the evolution of Bitcoin and its impact on several other cryptocurrencies in order to better understand this market. It has been shown that the price of many of the major cryptomoney systems is largely based on the Bitcoin price. Since all these currencies have been fluctuating along with Bitcoin for years, we decided to first calculate some correlation comparisons to see exactly how much of a hold BTC commands. 
    
    
    In a second step, we will turn to the analysis of Bitcoin flash crashes and how does it affect other cryptocurrencies.
